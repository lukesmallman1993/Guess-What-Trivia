## **Design Choices**

 ### **Fonts**
  ##### **Fonts**
  ![fonts](assets/images/fonts/font-1.png)
  ![fonts](assets/images/fonts/font-2.png)
  ![fonts](assets/images/fonts/font-3.png)
  ![fonts](assets/images/fonts/font-4.png)
  ![fonts](assets/images/fonts/font-5.png)
  ![fonts](assets/images/fonts/font-6.png)

  - For my font type it was a tricky one as there was so many on google font to choose from. After some testing and thinking I decided to go with Fredoka One as this was the most eye catching and easier to read. I also used san-serif as a backup just in case my font did not load.
  

 ### **Colours**
  ##### **White**
   - White is a sign of simplicity and its clean, These are what im looking for when creating my quiz. Ill be using white for the fonts so that they stand out from other colors.
  ##### **Red**
   - Red is associated with wrong and danger. Ill be using red for my incorrect answers on my questions to inducate that the question the user selected is incorrect.
  ##### **Green**
   - Green is associated with correct and Go. Ill be using green for my correct answers so that it tells the user that the question they have selected is correct.
   - I'll be using green for my progress bar in my quiz as when researching a color most of them where this color. This might change depending on what colors work well together.
  ##### **Blue**
   - This will be a temporary color for my background just to make it easier for me to see my changes.

## **Testing**
  ### **Performance Testing**
- The website was tested on Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.

- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as a Desktop , Tablet and Mobile.

- A large ammount of testing was done to make sure all the links worked.

- Friends and family where asked to review the website and give feedback on any changes I could make.


### **W3C Validator**
   - 1. Css - [Results](assets/images/validation/css.png)
   - 2. html - [Results](assets/images/validation/html.png)
   - 3. javascript - Codes were checked using [JSHINT](https://jshint.com/) - there where 2 warning ans these where the Missing semicolon and 'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

### **Color change**
 - I decided th change the progress bar as it was the same as the correct color which clashed with eachother. I went with orange as its the same color as the buttons ive been using so wanted to keep a consistency throughout.
 - Ive also kept the color blue for the background as it took me longer that I planned on the javascript side of my quiz app and wanted it to work first before I changed any of the background.

 - Another bug I had was the score at the end did not save which I wanted this to work but no one got back to me with a solution so had to also leave this out
